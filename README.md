# BoA-Consumer-Complaints
**Project Overview**

Bank of America (BoA), a financial institution based in the United States, has received numerous customer complaints over the years. To address this, BoA has decided to analyze consumer complaints related to its financial products and services from 2017 to 2023. A comprehensive dataset has been provided, containing detailed information on each complaint, including submission and receipt dates, associated products and issues, and BoA’s responses.

The primary goal of this case study is to analyze the data, identify patterns, and propose informed, data-driven recommendations that BoA can implement to effectively address and reduce customer complaints.


**Key Findings**

In 2018, the company faced a surge in complaints, with growth peaking at 46.84% — a clear signal of rising customer dissatisfaction. By 2022, this trend culminated in the highest number of complaints on record, reaching 12,936 cases. However, a turning point emerged in 2023: the company made significant strides, resulting in a sharp decline of 29.07% in total complaints and a 24.32% drop in closed complaints. This shift suggests that efforts to improve customer service and issue resolution may be paying off.

From 2017 to 2023, complaint trends varied significantly. In 2017, complaints steadily rose from Q2 to Q4. In 2018, they peaked mid-year and declined afterward. Complaints increased through Q3 of 2019 before dropping in Q4. A rapid surge defined 2020, while 2021 saw a sharp decline followed by a slight Q4 rise. In 2022, complaints dipped in Q2, spiked in Q3, then eased in Q4. Finally, 2023 showed a consistent, rapid decline in complaints throughout the year.

The “Pending” status in the Timely Response column, linked to the “In Progress” status in the Company Response to Consumer column, occurred only from May to August 2023, contributing to 16.28% of that year’s complaints.

The Checking or Savings Account product has consistently been the top contributor to complaints, accounting for 39.69% of all complaints between 2017 and 2023.


**Insights**

- Total Complaints from 2017 to 2023–62,516.
  
- Year with the highest number of issues — The year 2020 had the highest number of issues reported, likely influenced by the disruptions caused during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  
- Most Recurring Issue —The most recurring issue has been ‘Managing an Account,’ consistently reported across the years.
  
- Closed Complaints — Most complaints from 2017 to 2023 have been closed, except for cases from May to August 2023, which remain open due to pending company responses.


**Recommendation**

- Bank of America operates over 3,700 branches nationwide, making it accessible for customers who need in-person assistance. To improve complaint resolution, consumers should be encouraged to visit their nearest branch if they haven’t received a response within 7 working days. This can ensure a more direct and personalized way to address their concerns and prevent further delays in handling complaints.

- The Email submission channel had the fastest response time and resolved all complaints before being phased out in 2020. To ease the burden on the Web channel, promoting underused channels like Email or Phone for specific complaint types and introducing a mobile app submission option could provide customers with more diverse and efficient ways to submit their concerns.
  
- To enhance security and protect consumers from third-party access, enabling a two-step authentication process for account access is essential. This added layer of protection ensures that even if account credentials are compromised, unauthorized access is prevented. By requiring both something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (such as a phone for verification), consumers can better safeguard their personal and financial information from malicious threats.
